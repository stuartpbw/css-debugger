# `css-debugger`

A Chrome extension that helps you visually debug CSS by outlining elements on a web page.

## The Problem

When working with web pages that have large amounts of whitespace or elements that are very close together, it can be difficult to see how they are aligned and where one element ends and another begins. This can make debugging CSS issues a real pain.

## The Solution

The `css-debugger` extension provides a simple solution: it allows you to toggle a 1px outline on every element on the page. Each element is assigned a different color, making it easy to distinguish between them, even when they are overlapping.

## How to Use

1. **Install the extension.** (link to Chrome Web Store if available)
2. **Open the developer tools.** (Right-click on the page and select "Inspect")
3. **Click the `css-debugger` tab.**
4. **Toggle the "Enable Outlines" button.**

## Features

- **1px outlines on all elements:** Clearly see the boundaries of each element.
- **Different colors for each element:** Easily distinguish between overlapping elements.
- **Toggle on/off:** Quickly enable or disable the outlines as needed.

## Benefits

- **Debug CSS issues more efficiently:** Quickly identify alignment problems and overlapping elements.
- **Improve your understanding of web page layout:** Visualize how elements are positioned and interact with each other.
- **Save time and frustration:** Spend less time struggling to find the source of CSS problems.
